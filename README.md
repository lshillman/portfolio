## License
This project uses the [Hippocratic License, v3.0](https://firstdonoharm.dev). TL;DR, it's not *quite* open source, but as long as you're not violating human rights, being a fossil fuel company, conducting military operations, etc (see license for full details), you can essentially treat it as open source.
