        Hi! I'm Luke, a UX designer/researcher/developer living in Berkeley, CA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became a UX practitioner due to a simple belief that technology should work for humans. For my entire career, I have preferred to work toward the base of the hierarchy of needs, i.e., providing the essentials and relieving pain rather than focus on what the industry calls "delight." Delight is certainly nice, and I have nothing against it. It's just not where I live.

        This portfolio is to showcase projects where I've been a developer. For a more UX-oriented portfolio, see <a href="https://lukehillman.net">lukehillman.net</a>.
